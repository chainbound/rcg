# Introduction

This document is a collection of Rust coding guidelines used at [Chainbound](https://chainbound.io). It is meant primarily for internal use, but may be useful to others.

## Structure
Each guideline is in its own file, and is numbered and titled. An example could be: `RCG 111: Single Writer Principle`. We use either the number or the title to refer to the guideline. These guidelines are also meant to be used by AI code review agents to check for compliance.
